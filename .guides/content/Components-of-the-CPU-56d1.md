**The CU (control unit)**

The control unit co-ordinates the actions of the computer by sending out control
signals to the other parts of the CPU, such as the ALU and registers, and also
to the other components of the computer system.

An important element of the control unit is the **decoder** which decodes the program instructions (works out what they mean) that have been brought from the memory and decides what actions should be taken.
It then sends control signals to the other components to carry these actions out.


**The (ALU) arithmetic and logic unit**

The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations. It carries out activities such as:

- Addition and subtraction
- Comparisons such as whether one number is greater than another.
