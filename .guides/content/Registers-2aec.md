Registers are memory storage locations within the CPU itself. 
Some of these registers serve specific functions, but some of them are general purpose registers used for the quick storage of data items.

|MAR (Memory Address Register)  |Holds the address of the memory location currently being accessed. |
|MDR (Memory Data Register) |A temporary store (buffer) for any instruction or data copied from memory.|
|Program counter  |Holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched from main memory. |
|Accumulator |Intermediate store for the results of calculations carried out by the ALU. |

These registers will be referred to in the next lesson.
