The clock regulates the timing and speed of all computer functions. Within the clock is a quartz crystal which vibrates at a particular frequency and pulses of electricity are sent out to the other components to co-ordinate their activities.

One instruction can be carried out with each pulse of the clock, and therefore the higher the clock rate, the faster the CPU will be able to carry out the program instructions.

The clock speed is measured in cycles per second.

|  | **Units** |
| :------ | :----------- |
| 1 Hz (Hertz)| 1 cycle per second |
| 1 KHz (Kilohertz) | 1000 cycles per second |
|1 MHz (Megahertz) | 1,000,000 cycles per second |
|1 GHz (Gigahertz)| 1,000,000,000 cycles per second |


Rates of 1 to 3 GHz are common in most home computers. That is up to three thousand million instructions processed each second!
