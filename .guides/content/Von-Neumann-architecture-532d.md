The design of the CPU and the way in which it interacts with other components to carry out the program instructions is known as von Neumann architecture.

In 1945, John von Neumann proposed his design for a ‘stored program’ computer where both the program and data were stored in the memory.
His design included 

- a processing unit, 
- a program counter
- memory to store data and instructions 
- external storage 
- input and output mechanisms

**Interesting Fact**

EDSAC (Electronic Delayed Storage Automatic Computer) was developed in Britain and wad the first stored program computer to be put to commercial use when it was first used by J. Lyons & Co. in 1951. It was known as LEO, short for Lyons Electronic Office.
